# O365-MFA-Report
This report will pull an MFA report for all users in your O365 environment, and export that info to a csv document.
Also keep in mind that when you run this script, you will be asked to sign into your O365 tenant. Please sign into your Tenant with a Global admin account.
Once this report is done, and the csv is generated, the csv should show those users who have MFA enabled, enforced, and disabled. It should also should what MFA method that the user is currently using as an auth method.
